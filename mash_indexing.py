"""This method combines LINgroup indexing and mash together.
    Reasons:
        For mash, it's not able to detect mash distance when ANI is lower than 90%.
        For LINgroup indexing, the efficiency largely depends on how similar is the new submission
            to the genomes in the database.
        In light of this, we need to change our current workflow.
